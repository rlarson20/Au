# Detailed Refactoring Plan for Your LLM Agent Project

## 1. Code Organization - Building a Professional Package Structure

The first and most critical step is transforming your single-file project into a well-organized package.
This isn't just about aesthetics—it demonstrates to potential employers that you understand software engineering principles beyond just making code work.


Start by creating the directory structure I outlined earlier.
Each module should have a single, clear responsibility.
Your `agents/base.py` should contain an abstract base class that defines the interface all agents must implement.
This allows you to later add different LLM providers (GPT-4, Gemini, local models) without changing your core logic.
The `tools/filesystem.py` should contain only the file operation functions, while `tools/base.py` defines the `ToolDefinition` class and any tool-related interfaces.

When moving code, resist the urge to just copy-paste.
 Take this opportunity to review each function and class.
 For example, your `basic_type_converter` function could be enhanced to handle nested types and could live in `utils/schema.py` alongside other schema-generation utilities.
 Add proper `__init__.py` files that explicitly control what gets exported from each module—this shows you understand Python's module system and API design.

Create a proper package setup with `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`.
This allows installation via pip and shows you understand Python packaging.
Include metadata like version, author, and dependencies.
Consider using Poetry or PDM for dependency management—these modern tools show you're keeping up with Python ecosystem evolution.

## 2. Implementing a Robust Tool Registration System

Your current manual dictionary creation for tools is error-prone and doesn't scale.
A decorator-based registration system is more Pythonic and allows for better tool discovery and validation.
Here's how to implement this properly:

Create a global tool registry in `tools/registry.py` that maintains a singleton pattern. This registry should validate tools at registration time, checking that docstrings follow your expected format and that type hints are complete. Implement a `@tool` decorator that automatically registers functions and extracts their metadata. This decorator should be smart enough to handle various docstring formats (Google, NumPy, Sphinx styles) by using a library like `docstring_parser` rather than regex.

The registry should support tool namespacing (e.g., "filesystem.read", "git.commit") to organize tools as your collection grows. Implement tool versioning—tools might need updates, and you want to maintain backward compatibility. Add a discovery mechanism that can automatically import and register tools from a specific directory, making it easy to add new tools without modifying core code.

Consider implementing tool composition—complex tools built from simpler ones. This demonstrates understanding of functional programming concepts and shows you can build sophisticated systems from simple components.

## 3. Professional Error Handling and Logging

Replace generic exception catching with a hierarchy of custom exceptions. Create a `exceptions.py` module with specific exceptions like `ToolExecutionError`, `SchemaValidationError`, `LLMResponseError`. Each should carry relevant context—which tool failed, what arguments were passed, what the LLM was trying to do. This helps with debugging and shows attention to operational concerns.

Implement structured logging using Python's logging module with custom formatters. Create different log levels for different concerns: DEBUG for LLM prompts/responses, INFO for tool executions, WARNING for retries or fallbacks, ERROR for failures. Use context managers to add request IDs to all logs within a conversation, making it easy to trace issues.

Add telemetry for tool usage—track which tools are called most, which fail most often, execution times. This data is invaluable for optimization and demonstrates you think about performance and reliability. Consider integrating with OpenTelemetry for professional-grade observability.

## 4. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

Testing is often what separates junior from senior developers. Create a `tests/` directory with subdirectories mirroring your source structure. Start with unit tests for every pure function—these should be fast and test edge cases. For your tool functions, use `pytest` fixtures to create temporary directories and files, ensuring tests don't affect your actual filesystem.

For the agent class, implement integration tests using mock LLM responses. Use `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock` to simulate OpenRouter API responses. Test the full conversation flow: user input → LLM call → tool execution → response handling. Test error cases: what happens when tools fail? When the LLM returns malformed JSON? When API rate limits are hit?

Implement property-based testing using `hypothesis` for your schema generation code. This shows advanced testing knowledge and catches edge cases you might not think of. Add performance benchmarks using `pytest-benchmark` to track any regressions as you refactor.

Create fixtures that set up common test scenarios—a mock filesystem, a configured agent with mock tools, sample conversations. This makes writing new tests easier and shows you understand test maintainability.

## 5. Configuration Management

Professional applications separate configuration from code. Create a `config.py` using `pydantic-settings` (the settings management extension of Pydantic). Define different configuration classes for different environments (development, testing, production). Use environment variables with sensible defaults, but also support configuration files (YAML/TOML) for complex settings.

Implement configuration validation at startup—check API keys are valid, models exist, file permissions are correct. This prevents runtime failures and provides clear error messages. Add configuration hot-reloading for development, showing you understand developer experience.

Create a CLI using `click` or `typer` that allows overriding configuration via command-line arguments. This makes your tool flexible and scriptable. Support multiple configuration profiles (e.g., "fast" using GPT-3.5, "accurate" using GPT-4) that users can switch between easily.

## 6. Building Toward a Production-Ready Coding Agent

To evolve this into a sophisticated coding agent, implement these features incrementally:

**Code Understanding Tools**: Add tools that use Python's `ast` module to parse and analyze code. Implement tools for finding function definitions, extracting docstrings, identifying imports. Use `tree-sitter` for multi-language support. These tools should return structured data that the LLM can reason about, not just raw code strings.

**Safe Code Execution**: Implement a sandboxed execution environment using `subprocess` with timeout limits and resource constraints. For Python code, consider using `RestrictedPython` or Docker containers. Always validate generated code before execution—check for dangerous imports, system calls, or infinite loops.

**Project Management Capabilities**: Add tools for creating proper Python packages with appropriate structure, managing virtual environments, handling dependencies via pip/poetry. Implement template systems for common project types (web app, CLI tool, data pipeline).

**Intelligent Context Management**: Since LLMs have token limits, implement smart context windowing. Keep recent conversation, currently relevant code, and tool outputs, but summarize or drop older content. Use embeddings to retrieve relevant past conversation when needed.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**: Design specialized agents (architect for high-level design, coder for implementation, reviewer for code review, tester for test generation). Implement a coordinator agent that delegates tasks and synthesizes results. This shows advanced system design skills.

Remember, each feature should be implemented with the same attention to quality: proper tests, documentation, error handling, and logging. The goal isn't just to add features, but to show you can build maintainable, production-quality systems. This approach will make you stand out far more than cramming in half-working features.
